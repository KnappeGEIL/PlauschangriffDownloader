## Installation

To run the ruby script you need a working ruby installation, obviously (tested to work with versions > 2.3.1) and the following gems:

Or you can just download the ocra packaged exe from the releases page.

## Usage

If you want to run the ruby script:

* open a command prompt and navigate to the lib folder.
* Execute `ruby main.rb`

To run the exe
* Just unpack and execute

After you launched the application select all podcasts you want and hit the download button.

The files will be saved to the directory from where you launched the program.
